The Real-world Heart Patient Data Project was a significant undertaking where I leveraged my skills in data analytics and machine learning to analyze a comprehensive dataset related to heart patients. The dataset included a multitude of predictor variables that aimed to predict whether an individual had heart disease or not. The primary objective was to develop accurate predictive models to aid in diagnosing and understanding the factors influencing heart disease. So first, I wrote an introduction regarding the topic and my dataset and how I aimed to carry out the project.

Data Exploration: Conducted an in-depth exploration of the dataset, understanding the distribution of variables, identifying outliers, and assessing data quality. Loaded in my libraries, checked dimensions, checked for missing data. I then conducted exploratory data analysis on the predictor variables that I felt to be most relevant or important, on their own, in relation to the target variable, or in relation to one another. This allowed me to gain some initial results and knowledge, and make inferences, especially regarding the correlations between predictor variables themselves, as well as the target variable.

Data Splitting: This consisted of splitting the data into training and testing data, creating recipes, exploring correlations between continuous variables, predicting the outcome variable using our recipes, and stratified sampling.

Model Building: Developed and implemented machine learning models, including but not limited to decision trees, random forests, and other algorithms, to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on the given features. Logistic regression model, Linear Discriminant Analysis Model for classification, quadratic discriminant analysis model for classification, KNN model (or k-nearest neighbors model). 

Model Fitting and Tuning: Conducted rigorous model tuning to enhance predictive accuracy, employing techniques such as hyperparameter optimization. Cross validation with random forests, ranger and xgboost engines, models fitted to folded data.

Model Selection and Performance Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of different models, selecting the most effective one based on metrics like area under ROC curve on training data and testing data, heatmaps. 

Insights and Recommendations: Derived meaningful insights from the analysis, highlighting significant predictors of heart disease. Generated actionable recommendations based on the model outcomes, and wrote conclusion regarding all of this.
